# ArSLR-ML : A Python-Based Machine Learning Application for Arabic Sign Language Recognition



# ArSLR-ML workflow
The process of predicting Arabic Sign Language Recognition (ArSLR) using a multi-class ML-based model, specifically support vector machines, involves six stages in total: Image Collection (stage 1), Feature Extract  ion (stage 2), Preprocessing (stage 3), Classification (stage 4), Model Evaluation (stage 5), and Finally Real-Time Recognition (stage 6). The architecture of the ArSLR model is depicted in Figure below:
